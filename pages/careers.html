                    <h2>Working at Azimuth1</h2>
                    <p>Headquartered just outside our Nation's Capital, but working from across the globe, Azimuth1 has a great mix of challenging work and flexible lifestyle that can fit almost any situation. We are very family friendly, supporting adjusted schedules for childcare and pickup times.
                    We appreciate the benefits that can come from working from home like having no commute, fewer expenses for travel and business attire, plus the comfort and convenience.  Being a remote organization does come with challenges - you need to be self motivated, eager to communicate with your team in multiple channels to keep everyone
                    aligned and working together to achive our goals.  If you are a top performer in your field, and would like to create amazing new tech with others who speak your language, this may be the place for you.</p>
