                    <p>Azimuth1 is a fast moving team of data analytics and computer science experts on a mission to bring specialty data analysis applications to environmental, public safety, and national security challenges. Our products are used by Fortune 500 companies, government agencies, and emergency first responders to make better decisions faster.

The tools of our trade are typically statistical learning methods, geospatial data modeling and GIS, and interactive data visualization on the web leveraging open source software throughout our process. Our philosophy is that we should spend our efforts customizing tools and methods to suit particular industries rather than build generic tools to try to suit everyone. We've observed that each industry has its own terminology, practices, assumptions, and way of approaching a problem. In order to solve a problem it helps to engage fully with those that are knee deep in it, so we jump in with them and try to build a solution that fits that industry rather than build one solution for everyone. We belive your industry deserves its own tailored fit. Ultimately the product is far better and the adoption rate has been far more solid with the industry tailored approach. The problems we aim to solve get solved quicker too.

We hope you'll get in touch with us if you're interested in partnering on your next project or if you'd just like to hash out some interesting ideas. If you're interested in a career with Azimuth1, drop us a note at contact@azimuth1.com and let us know. We'll be in touch with a list of really hard problems we're working to solve.</p>
